NetPorter: A Social Network Transition Tool for Multiple Platforms

NetPorter is an open-source project designed to facilitate the seamless transition of user follow networks between social media platforms. Initially targeting Twitter, NetPorter aims to be a general platform capable of cloning networks on any social media platform with a relevant network structure, such as Substack Notes.

The main feature of NetPorter is its account verification system, which confirms the ownership of a user's source platform account by requesting them to share a unique code within a specific timeframe. This method provides a secure way to authenticate users and minimize fraudulent activities.

Once a user's account is verified, NetPorter replicates their follow connections on the source platform, among users who have NetPorter accounts. The tool ensures consistent tracking of the source network by implementing a straightforward update process that captures any changes in the user's follow list. The resulting subgraph is then used as a basis for plugins, designed to recommend users to follow on target platforms based on their existing connections.

NetPorter aims to address the network effect challenge that makes it difficult for users to switch between social media platforms, providing a flexible and personalized online experience. By focusing on portability and adaptability, NetPorter empowers users to redefine their online presence across multiple platforms with ease.
